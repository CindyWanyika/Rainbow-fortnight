Welcome to my GitHub repository containing solutions to LeetCode problems! This repository is a collection of coding problems I have solved to enhance my problem-solving skills and practice data structures and algorithms.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the category or topic of the problem, such as Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, etc. Each folder contains Python files with the solutions to the problems.


Problem-Solving Approach

For each problem, I follow this approach:

Understand the problem statement and constraints.

Identify the optimal algorithm or data structure.

Write the solution in Python.

Test the solution with sample test cases and edge cases.

Optimize the solution for better time and space complexity (if possible).

How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

Navigate to the desired folder based on difficulty level.

Open the Python file corresponding to the problem.
